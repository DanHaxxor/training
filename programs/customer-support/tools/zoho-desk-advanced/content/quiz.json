          ],
          "correct": 2,

        {
          "question": "What is the key difference between 'Create' and 'Edit' workflow triggers?",
          "options": [
            "Create triggers are faster to execute",
            "Create runs once when ticket is new; Edit can run multiple times on updates",

          ],
          "correct": 1,
          "explanation": "Create rules execute only once when a ticket is first created. Edit rules can run multiple times throughout the ticket lifecycle whenever the ticket is updated or modified."

          ],
          "correct": 2,
          "explanation": "Supervisor rules trigger approximately once every hour to scan tickets and perform actions, unlike workflows that trigger on specific events."

          ],
          "correct": 2,
          "explanation": "Sentiment Analysis can be used as a condition in workflow rules to escalate tickets with negative sentiment, adjust priority, or notify supervisors based on customer emotional tone."
