      "content": "No matter what business you're in or where you're located, a company's goal is the same: **offer something someone wants to buy, and make the sale**. To reach that goal, many businesses use marketing to get people interested in what they're offering. Depending on the business, the secondary goal is often return sales which can be driven by additional marketing post-sale."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "But getting someone interested is only part of the story. After you've sparked interest, the next step is helping them see why they should buy, or why they should continue buying. Sometimes a potential customer already understands the value before they find you. Other times they see other choices and need to be convinced why your product or service is the better pick."

This series of steps is called a **sales cycle**. Having a defined sales cycle helps your team move deals forward reliably and recognize where deals are stalling."

For a sales cycle, they let you map out those stages we just discussed, track prospects as they move from interest to decision, assign tasks, and keep everything organized. Knowing your sales cycle clearly makes the tool much more useful and the tool makes your sales cycle much more manageable."
